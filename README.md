# VolumeCalculatorApp
VolumeCalculatorApp is an Android project designed to practice the concepts of Adapters and GridView. The main screen features a GridView displaying four shapes: Sphere, Cylinder, Cube, and Prism. Each grid item includes an image of the shape and its name. When a shape is clicked, a new screen appears to calculate the volume of the shape.
