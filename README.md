# VolumeCalculatorApp üìèüî¢

VolumeCalculatorApp is an Android project designed to practice the concepts of Adapters and GridView. The main screen features a GridView displaying four shapes: Sphere, Cylinder, Cube, and Prism. Each grid item includes an image of the shape and its name. When a shape is clicked, a new screen appears where you can enter the required dimensions and calculate the volume of the shape. This app uses multiple intents to navigate to different activities for each shape's volume calculation.
